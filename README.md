# SeismoMate

The "SeismoMate" repository is a simple collection of useful links to coding and data management resources for geophysicists working in the field of seismology. It aims to provide easy access to valuable resources that can help seismologists improve their coding skills and manage their data more effectively.

In the future, SeismoMate may add some tutorials and sample projects to help seismologists develop good coding practices and improve their documentation skills. However, the main focus of the repository is to provide a curated list of links that can help seismologists find useful resources quickly and easily.

Whether you are an experienced seismologist or a beginner in the field, SeismoMate can be a helpful resource to enhance your coding and data management skills.


# Structure

For now the project is just simply a GitHub repository with folders and Readme's to keep it as simple as possible. For the future the aim is to host all the information in an easily accesible website.

# How to commit

The easiest way to commit is to use Github.dev, which allows editing a repository in your browser without cloning or downloading the repository.


To access Github.dev change the link of the repository from `github.com/spin-itn/SeismoMate` to `github.dev/spin-itn/SeismoMate` or just click on the following link: [github.dev/spin-itn/SeismoMate](https://github.dev/spin-itn/SeismoMate)

This opens a web VScode envirnoment in which you can change the markdown files making up the repositories as you like and commit any changes directly.
