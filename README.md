# SeismotMate

The "SeismoMate" repository is a simple collection of useful links to coding and data management resources for geophysicists working in the field of seismology. It aims to provide easy access to valuable resources that can help seismologists improve their coding skills and manage their data more effectively.

In the future, SeismoMate may add some tutorials and sample projects to help seismologists develop good coding practices and improve their documentation skills. However, the main focus of the repository is to provide a curated list of links that can help seismologists find useful resources quickly and easily.

Whether you are an experienced seismologist or a beginner in the field, SeismoMate can be a helpful resource to enhance your coding and data management skills.
